\indent\indent Based on our analysis, we found it very important for us to find solution to solve the current problem which protects the young generation from violent content meanwhile encourages the game designers to create new production. The current policy focuses on rating system and sale restriction. These two methods work jointly. Rating system categorizes games into different ages of gamer according to the contents. And distributors will be able to sell the product based on their rating. With the sale restriction, government regulates the selling behaviors of distributors so that they will not take risk to sell product to inappropriate users. However, from our analysis we see such regulations are way to far from being enough since it doesn't respect the feeling of game designers and definitely hurt their passion for creation. Therefore, it is necessary for us to make balance between users and developers. 

Law is the direct and powerful way. However, current law doesn't fully respect the creative work of game developers, which they modify the content of game arbitrarily making it inconsistent and break the story into several independent parts. For the developers, this modification deviates their original design of games and frustrate their motivation to develop new games. When the online game "World of Warcraft" was introduced into China, the game was modified tremendously due to violent content. For instance, in this game, the color of blood was changed into green which is even opposite to the common sense. To balance the both sides, it could legislate that requires game manufacturers to develop different versions for users, which younger people would see the non-violence version but keep the integrity of the content at the same time. Moreover, to make such legislation effective, it needs to build a better rating system which rates a game not only considering its content but also thoroughly consider other factors related to the use and distribution of the game. 

Market. 

We could also require the developers to create identify mechanism in the code to track the use of the game in order to assure that a game containing violent content was used by a legally gamer.
For example, there exists such possibility that the game sold legally but was borrowed to a teenage to play with.
