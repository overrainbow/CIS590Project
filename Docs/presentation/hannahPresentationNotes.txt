Examining this issue from a Kantian perspective shows it to be unethical. By the first formulation, if every media company was subjected to censorship by the government, then media would not be unique and could not explore issues deemed “inappropriate” by some third party. Governments would have the say as to what is “unsuitable,” but this may not reflect the ideas brought forth by the governed citizens. Furthermore, this would not be respecting the individual rights of the citizens, who should be free to watch, read, or play whatever they wish.

The second formulation agrees. By removing or altering pieces of a person or group’s intellectual property, governments are imposing their views on the public and not respecting the artistic freedom of the IP’s creators. Restricting the sales of games to any party is condescending, treating people as if they cannot know what is morally right or wrong. Thus in both manners of restriction, citizens and creators are being treated as means to an end. By both formulations, we see video game censorship and restriction to be wrong.

Further arguments against censorship include the suppression of free speech and individual rights, along with the lack of proof that video games cause violence. Developers feel they are unable to express their creativity if their work is censored. Customers feel that restrictions on the sale or content of games inhibits their rights as individuals to play what they wish. And lastly, the studies on violence in games currently flooding the academic world only show correlations between violence and game play. Proof of causation has not been shown. Since it has taken so long to have a definitive answer, many people feel it unfair to censor or otherwise restrict media that has not been proven to cause negative behavior.
